# hello_flutter

Aaron's Test Flutter Project.

# building and running notes
* needed to run `flutter doctor` and go thru checklist of installs + brew installs
* had to generate flutter project then open the xcworkspace in xcode and select provisioning profile
* for android, had to open android studio and run SDK manager downloads
* had to make sure to create a unique bundle identifier (com.example.uniqueprojectname)
* used some of the workaround steps here
 https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/26123

 * key features -- had to open xcode/android studio once each to setup, but afterwards can develop and debug completely from VSCode (or Android Studio)
